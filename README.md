# Description
In addition to the Trailhead module covered ("[Platform Event Basics](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/platform_events_basics)"), which practices subscribing to Platform Event via Apex, other ways to subscribe/publish platform events are also demonstrated.  The code / config used is collected here.

# Code
* A platform event
* A screen flow that publishes the platform event
* A process that subscribes to the platform event
* A Lightning Web Component (used in Utility Bar) that subscribes to the platform event
